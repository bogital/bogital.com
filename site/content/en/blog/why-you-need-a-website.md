Do you know that 6 million people connect to the internet every day in Cameroon? With the rise of the so-called “Android Generation”, faster internet speeds and powerful smartphone; it is necessary to have a professionally designed website or at least a Facebook page in Cameroon.

Most businesses in Africa and Cameroon,  don't have an online presence. Some of these startups don't even plan of creating a website nor a Facebook page. Below, you will find five reasons why you should create your website for your startup or local business.

### Increased credibility of your business.
In Cameroon, many people are victims of scams on social media like Facebook. BUT  If you have a Facebook page for your startup, then you are a step ahead of the competition. Remember that Facebook is free(not really!), so anyone can log in to create a new page in 5mins.
A professionally designed website and a private email will add credibility to your startup and your Facebook Page. Having a website for a home based business is a go-to solution to add credibility to your business.

### You save money!
 You might feel like the initial investment might be too big if you are starting up but in the long run; it will worth the cost of designing your website and online marketing strategies with Bogital. Advertising online with a website or facebook page is three times cheaper than traditional advertisement methods.

### You don't pay taxes
No law in Cameroon imposes taxes on website owners. It's easy to get started with your ideas, a facebook page and a website. You can sell your goods from your website without ever spending a penny to pay a tax or rent a dedicated store for your products.

### Increased Accessibility
Have you ever had to turn down on customers because it's closing time? I know that you know that a website is always open to your potential customers. They can get all the information about your business, products or services even when you sleep. You can also contact them if they leave their contact on your web site.

### Target larger Markets
Your website is available to the everywhere on earth(where there is internet!).  Thereby increasing your chances for your skills, products or services to be noticed out of Cameroon. You will have the opportunity to sell at the international level with your website.
